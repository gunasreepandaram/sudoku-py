This is a python porgram thst solves a "sudoku puzzle" using a "recursive backtraking" alogorithm.
the program defines a recursive function "solve(bo)" that takes a 2D list "bo" representing the  sudoku board as input. 
The function attempts to fill the board with numbers from the 1 to 9.
the "solve" funtoin is the main recursive function that solves then puzzle. It iterates through each cell ,trying numbers from 1 to 9.And checks if the number can be placed using the "possible" funtion.
The "posible" funtion checks if a given number can be placed at a specific position on the board,follows the sudoku rules.
If the recursive call returns "TRUE", the puzzle is solved ,and the function ruturn "TRUE".
if the recursive call returns "FALSE",the current number can not be placed ,and the funtion resets the cell to 0 and returns "FALSE".
the main program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm,which tries number from 1 to 9 for each empty cell ,and backtracks when a number can not be placed . 
this process continues untill the puzzle is solved or all posibilities have been exhausted.
