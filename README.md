This is a simple python program that solves suduku puzzle using a "recursive backtracing" algorithm.
this program defines a recursive function "solve(bo)" that takes a 2D list bo representing the suduku board as input.
And this function attempts to fill in the board numbers from 1to9.
The "solve" function is the main recursive function that solves the puzzle.it iterates through each cell,tying numbers from 1 to 9,and check if the number can be placed using the "possible"function.
The "possible" funnction checks the if a given number can be placed specific position on the board,followsnthe sudoku rules.
If the recursive call returns "TRUE",the puzle is solved,and returns True.
If the reursive call returns "FALSE",the current number can not be placed,and the function resets the cell to 0 and returns "FALSE".
The main program initialies an empty suduku board , prints it, calls the "solve" function to sovle the puzzle,and print the solved board.
